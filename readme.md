PulseLock
=============

Won the overall 3rd place at Yale Hackathon 2016 and placed first in the micro controller challenge.

A simple f.lux-like plugin that blurs your screen as a lock. In order to unlock the screen, increase your heart beat above a certain threshold by doing small physical exercises. Once your heart beat is high enough to increase measure it against a heart beat controller (MAXREFDES117).
