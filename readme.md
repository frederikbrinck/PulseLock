Blur
=============

Submission for YHack2016.

A simple f.lux-like plugin that blurs your screen as a lock. In order to unlock
the screen, increase your heart beat enough by doing small physical exercises
to increase your pulse and measure it against the heart beat controller
(MAXREFDES117).

Ideal extensions:
-----------------
- Better UI 
- Blurring of all spaces
- More customisability
- More accurate heart beat reader
- FitBit and AppleWatch integration

Blur the screen so your heart wont fade!
